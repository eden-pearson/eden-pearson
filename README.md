### Kia ora!  👋


I'm a Full Stack Developer committed to crafting inclusive and accessible software, aiming to make a positive impact on the lives of everyday New Zealanders. Currently, I'm working on developing technology solutions to empower māori communities in northland


My journey into tech began during my time as a digital marketer in the healthcare industry, where I got an inside look into the transformative potential of technology. This sparked my curiosity and led me to explore coding during my free time and then training with Dev Academy Aotearoa

Ongoing projects:
- te reo māori learning app
- personal portfolio website
