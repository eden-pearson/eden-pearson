### Kia ora!  👋


I'm a Full Stack Developer committed to crafting inclusive and accessible software.


My journey into tech began during my time as a digital marketer in the healthcare industry, where I got an inside look into the transformative potential of technology. This sparked my curiosity and led me to explore coding during my free time, then training with Dev Academy Aotearoa and finally pursuing a Master's in Applied Computing at Lincoln University.

Current projects:
- te reo māori mobile game
- mental wellbeing mobile app
