### Kia ora!  👋


I'm a Full Stack Developer committed to crafting inclusive and accessible software, aiming to make a positive impact on the lives of everyday kiwis. Currently, I'm working on developing technology solutions to empower māori communities in Tai Tokerau (northland)


My journey into tech began during my time as a digital marketer in the healthcare industry, where I got an inside look into the transformative potential of technology. This sparked my curiosity and led me to explore coding during my free time and then training with Dev Academy Aotearoa

Ongoing projects:
- waitangi marae website
- te reo māori learning web app
- personal portfolio website
- habit tracking mobile app
